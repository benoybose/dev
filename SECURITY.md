# Security Policy

## Defaults

The agent requires approval for file writes and command execution by default.
Workspace paths are resolved and must remain inside the configured workspace.
Shell execution uses argument arrays with `shell=False`, bounded output, timeouts,
and process cleanup.

Do not use `--approve-all` in an untrusted or shared workspace.

## Reporting

Do not disclose security issues publicly before maintainers have had an
opportunity to investigate. Include reproduction steps, affected version, and
platform details in a private maintainer report.
