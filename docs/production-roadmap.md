# Production Readiness Roadmap

This roadmap defines the work required to move `devx` from a strong staging
implementation to a production-ready coding agent. It is intentionally gated:
each phase has explicit acceptance criteria, and a later phase must not be
considered complete because an earlier phase is unfinished.

## Current baseline

The project currently has:

- A local-first CLI and Textual TUI.
- Provider and model configuration through `.env`, user configuration, and
  the reusable `/setup` panel.
- Curated provider model catalogs for coding and tool-calling models.
- Slash-command autocomplete and `@` workspace mentions.
- Approval-gated workspace tools.
- Session persistence, export/import, rollback support, and async checkpoint
  support.
- Bounded approval previews, `/diff`, `/undo`, `/plan`, and CLI `--plan-only`.
- Configurable lint/test checks, bounded context selection, and structured
  cancellation.
- Model-aware semantic caching and a deterministic offline benchmark suite.
- Ordered project permissions, bounded context compaction, a shared tool
  registry, workspace plugins, and stdio MCP tool support.
- Unit, TUI, mocked integration, and configuration tests.

The latest local validation includes 70 passing tests, provider-contract
coverage, linting, compilation, diff validation, and passing offline
benchmarks. This is not yet equivalent to live-provider, cross-platform,
security, or release acceptance.

## Phase 1: Runtime foundation (implemented; hardening remains)

### Objectives

The core runtime behavior expected from a reliable coding agent is implemented.
Remaining work is focused on cross-platform and live-provider hardening.

### Work items

1. ~~Replace custom synchronous orchestration with a durable LangGraph
   `StateGraph` for planner, coder, tester, and supervisor stages.~~
2. ~~Persist graph state and checkpoints so interrupted runs can resume safely.~~
3. ~~Implement a bounded tester/fix loop with explicit maximum attempts.~~
4. ~~Detect common project test frameworks and select safe test commands.~~
5. ~~Integrate token and agent-event streaming into the TUI transcript.~~
6. ~~Complete conversational session resume, including transcript restoration,
   active session switching, and recovery after process restart.~~
7. ~~Make provider and model changes refresh the active status and apply clearly
   to future runs.~~
8. ~~Keep all command failures user-visible and non-fatal to the TUI.~~

### Exit criteria

- The implemented runtime acceptance criteria are covered by deterministic and
  mocked tests; credentialed live acceptance and full cross-platform recovery
  testing remain release gates.

## Phase 2: Test and quality hardening

### Objectives

Make regressions difficult to introduce and make failures diagnosable.

### Required test layers

#### Unit tests

Cover:

- Configuration precedence and secret masking.
- Provider and model catalog filtering.
- Command parsing and autocomplete.
- Workspace path containment.
- Approval policies.
- Context bounds and deterministic file selection.
- Approval previews, diff/undo, plan-only, lint configuration, and benchmark
  behavior.
- Session serialization, import, export, rename, and recovery.
- Retry and cancellation state transitions.

#### Integration tests

Use mocked providers and temporary workspaces to verify:

- OpenAI-compatible model discovery.
- Tool-call request and response handling.
- Provider authentication and rate-limit errors.
- Planner-to-coder-to-tester transitions.
- Approval prompts around file and command operations.
- Session persistence across multiple runs.
- TUI command flows and modal interactions.

#### Live acceptance tests

Run separately from the deterministic suite using explicit credentials. Verify
at least one supported provider can:

- Answer a normal prompt.
- Produce a tool/function call.
- Read a workspace file.
- Make an approved minimal edit.
- Run a project test command.
- Report test failures and perform a bounded repair.
- Handle cancellation and provider errors cleanly.

### Exit criteria

- The deterministic suite passes without network access.
- Mocked integration tests cover every critical external boundary.
- Live acceptance tests pass against at least one credentialed provider.
- No test depends on credentials, a developer home directory, or a dirty
  workspace.
- Existing warnings are either resolved or documented with an owner and
  deadline.

## Phase 3: Cross-platform CI/CD

### Required matrix

Run the required checks on:

| Operating system | Python versions |
|---|---|
| Ubuntu Linux | supported minimum and latest supported |
| Windows | supported minimum and latest supported |
| macOS | supported minimum and latest supported |

### Required CI checks

```text
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -c constraints.txt -e ".[agent,tui,cli,dev]"
python -m pytest -q
python -m ruff check src tests scripts
python -m compileall -q src tests scripts
python scripts/benchmark.py
```

Add separate jobs for:

- Package build.
- Clean wheel installation.
- TUI smoke tests with Textual installed.
- Dependency and security scanning.
- Optional live-provider acceptance tests.

### Branch and release rules

- `develop` is the integration branch.
- Feature branches merge into `develop` through pull requests.
- `release/*` branches stabilize a release candidate.
- `main` contains production releases only.
- Required CI checks must pass before merging into `develop` or `main`.
- Semantic versioning must be derived from the release branch and commit
  metadata, with no manual version drift between package metadata and runtime
  version information.

### Exit criteria

- The full matrix passes for every release candidate.
- A fresh checkout can build and install the wheel on all three operating
  systems.
- CI fails closed when tests, lint, build, or security checks fail.
- Offline benchmarks pass without provider credentials.
- Release artifacts are retained and checksummed.

## Phase 4: Security and dependency readiness

### Required scans

Run project-scoped scans in a clean environment:

```text
pip-audit
bandit -r src
```

Also review dependency licenses and transitive dependency changes during every
release.

### Security requirements

- Never write API keys to transcripts, session state, or event logs.
- Mask secrets in `/config show`, diagnostics, and error reports.
- Keep `.env` and user config files out of version control.
- Enforce workspace containment for `@` mentions and tool paths.
- Require approval for writes, deletes, shell commands, and other risky tools.
- Apply command timeouts, output limits, and tool-call budgets.
- Validate imported sessions before writing them to the session database.
- Avoid logging full prompts or file contents by default.
- Review all URL fetching and subprocess calls before release.

### Exit criteria

- No unresolved critical or high-severity project dependency vulnerabilities.
- Security scans run automatically in CI.
- A manual review confirms secret, workspace, approval, and subprocess
  boundaries.
- Security regression tests cover every previously fixed issue.

## Phase 5: Clean installation and operator validation

Test from a clean checkout and a clean user environment.

### Virtual environment validation

```text
python -m venv .venv
```

Windows:

```text
.venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -c constraints.txt -e ".[agent,tui,cli,dev]"
devx doctor
devx --help
devx
```

Linux and macOS:

```text
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -c constraints.txt -e ".[agent,tui,cli,dev]"
devx doctor
devx --help
devx
```

### Wheel validation

```text
python -m build
python -m pip install dist/*.whl
devx doctor
```

Verify that the installed command works from a directory outside the project
and that `DEVX_WORKSPACE` follows the command's current working directory as
documented.

### Exit criteria

- Editable and wheel installs both work.
- `devx`, `devx doctor`, `devx --help`, and the default TUI launch work.
- First-time provider setup works without pre-existing configuration.
- `.env` and user-wide configuration precedence is correct.
- Clipboard, autocomplete, modal navigation, and session commands work on all
  supported operating systems.

## Phase 6: Observability and operations

Add the controls needed to support real users without exposing sensitive data.

- Structured logs with run, session, provider, and model identifiers.
- Secret and sensitive-content redaction before logging.
- Clear error categories for configuration, provider, tool, test, timeout, and
  cancellation failures.
- Configurable retry, timeout, token, and tool-call budgets.
- Diagnostic export that excludes API keys and sensitive file contents.
- Health information through `devx doctor`.
- Documented recovery, rollback, and session-export procedures.
- A support process for provider outages and model catalog changes.

### Exit criteria

- A failed run can be diagnosed from redacted logs and a diagnostic export.
- Operators can distinguish configuration failures from provider failures.
- Recovery and rollback procedures are documented and tested.

## Phase 7: Release candidate and production gate

Create a release candidate only after Phases 1–6 are complete.

### Release candidate checklist

- [ ] All unit and integration tests pass.
- [ ] Live provider acceptance tests pass.
- [ ] Linux, Windows, and macOS CI passes.
- [ ] Clean editable and wheel installation passes.
- [ ] TUI works with the installed Textual runtime.
- [ ] `devx doctor` reports a healthy installation.
- [ ] Security and dependency scans pass.
- [ ] No critical or high-severity open defects remain.
- [ ] Documentation matches the shipped command and configuration behavior.
- [ ] Version, changelog, and release artifacts are consistent.
- [ ] Rollback and support procedures are ready.

### Production release procedure

1. Create a `release/x.y.z` branch from `develop`.
2. Run the complete CI matrix and live acceptance suite.
3. Review dependency, security, and release notes changes.
4. Build and verify source and wheel artifacts.
5. Merge the release branch into `main`.
6. Create and push the signed semantic-version tag.
7. Publish artifacts only after the tag workflow passes.
8. Merge the release changes back into `develop`.
9. Monitor the first release and record any operational issues.

## Definition of production-ready

The project is production-ready only when every release-candidate checklist
item is complete and the following statement is true:

> A new user can install `devx` on a supported operating system, configure a
> supported provider, run an approval-gated coding task, recover from a failed
> or interrupted run, and receive safe, diagnosable behavior without exposing
> credentials or leaving the workspace boundary.
